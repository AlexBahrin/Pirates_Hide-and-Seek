# Pirates_Hide-and-Seek
*A C++ game developed in collaboration with my colleague, Ioniță Răzvan-Andrei, for our Introduction to Programming course, inspired by the classic board game Pirates Hide and Seek.

*A short presentation of the game: https://youtu.be/pvROfOE_UbI

*This game features:
-An Auto-Solver, that shows you one of the winning solutions
-An Auto-Generated Map, that always garantees an existent solution
-A Save feature, that saves the Time, the Board, and the placement of the Islands
-A LeaderBoard, that remembers all the users that played on a device
